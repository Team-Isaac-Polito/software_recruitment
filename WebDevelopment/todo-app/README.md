# Build a Simple Todo List App

Create a responsive Todo List application using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Vite.js. The application should allow the user to:

- Add new tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Delete tasks.

The interface should be clean and user-friendly, and the application should update dynamically without refreshing the page.

### Requirements:

- Use React.js for the logic.
- Style the app with Tailwind CSS.
- Use Vite.js for development.
- Include a responsive design.
- Ensure a clear structure of components (e.g., separate components for the task list, task item, and input form).
